Description: Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are a formal foundation for making probabilistic models of linear sequence. They provide a conceptual toolkit for building complex models just by drawing an intuitive picture. They are at the heart of a diverse range of programs, including genefinding, profile searches, multiple sequence alignment and regulatory site identification. HMMs are the Legos of computational sequence analysis. In graph theory, a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path, or equivalently a connected acyclic undirected graph. Tree represents the nodes connected by edges. It is a non-linear data structure. A poly-tree is simply a directed acyclic graph whose underlying undirected graph is a tree. The model proposed in this package is the same as an HMM but where the states are linked via a polytree structure rather than a simple path.
